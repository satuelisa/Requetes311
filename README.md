# Requetes311

A case study using the [City of Montreal 311 data
set](https://data.montreal.ca/dataset/5866f832-676d-4b07-be6a-e99c21eb17e4/resource/2cfa0e06-9be4-49a6-b7f1-ee9f2363a872/download/requetes311.csv)
to follow the lessons of Nathan George's book [Practical Data Science
with
Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/practical-data-science-with-python/9781801071970).

To view the notebook, you can use
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/satuelisa/Requetes311/blob/main/CaseStudy.ipynb). It
has so many images and animations that it does not render at GitHub as
a whole at present. I may slice it up in the future, sorry about that.
